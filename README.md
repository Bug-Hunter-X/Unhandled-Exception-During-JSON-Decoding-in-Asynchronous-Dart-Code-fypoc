# Unhandled Exception During JSON Decoding in Asynchronous Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart programming:  failure to correctly handle exceptions that may arise during JSON decoding within an asynchronous operation. The provided `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to fetch data from a remote API, but lacks comprehensive error handling for JSON decoding and key access failures.

The `bugSolution.dart` file offers a corrected version, incorporating more robust error handling to address potential exceptions during the JSON decoding process and prevent unexpected crashes.
